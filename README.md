# GPS-SMART

**GPS-SMART** is an application under development that helps users plan their trips efficiently by choosing whether to save **time** or **money**. By intelligently analyzing routes using the Google Maps API, the app suggests the best decision based on the user's preferences.

## Features
- **Origin and Destination**: Users can input their starting point and desired destination.
- **Save Time or Money**: Users choose their trip priority:
  - **Time**: The fastest route.
  - **Money**: The most economical route.
- **Route Analysis**: Uses the Google Maps API to calculate the best route based on the user's choice.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
- **Axios**: Library for making HTTP requests.
- **Google Maps API (Routes)**: For route analysis and calculating time and distance.
- **Zod**: For data validation and manipulation.
- **TailwindCSS**: CSS framework for styling.
- **Radix**: Accessible UI components to enhance the design.

## Project Status
The application is currently in **development** and is being created as I deepen my knowledge of these technologies in parallel. The current focus is on:
- Integrating with the Google Maps API.
- Creating a simple and functional interface.
- Validating user input data.

## Next Steps
- Finalize the route analysis logic.
- Improve the interface design using Radix and TailwindCSS.
- Implement tests to ensure code quality.
